# 🗓️ RA-YOLO Implementation Planning - Team 15

## ✅ Week 5 (May 19 – May 25): Baseline + Start RA-YOLO Integration

- [ ] Verify YOLOv5 training and inference on chosen dataset
- [ ] Set up base evaluation pipeline
- [ ] Design RA-YOLO adaptation logic (e.g. dynamic resolution switching strategy)
- [ ] Begin integrating resolution adaptation into YOLOv5 inference pipeline
- [ ] Identify and document required changes to YOLOv5 modules

## ✅ Week 6 (May 26 – June 1): Finalize RA-YOLO Implementation

- [ ] Complete integration of resolution adaptation mechanism
- [ ] Implement auxiliary logic (e.g. confidence-based resolution triggers)
- [ ] Run preliminary tests: compare static vs adaptive resolution
- [ ] Analyze and log intermediate results
- [ ] Document implementation details for the report

## ✅ Week 7 (June 2 – June 8): Evaluation, Iteration & Start Report

- [ ] Run final experiments (YOLOv5 baseline vs RA-YOLO)
- [ ] Tune adaptation parameters / thresholds
- [ ] Evaluate speed/accuracy trade-offs
- [ ] Create result plots and tables
- [ ] Draft report structure:
  - [ ] Introduction
  - [ ] Related Work
  - [ ] Method
  - [ ] Implementation

## ✅ Week 8 (June 9 – June 15): Final Report + Final Experiments

- [ ] Run any ablation studies or extra evaluations (if needed)
- [ ] Write complete report content:
  - [ ] Results
  - [ ] Discussion
  - [ ] Conclusion
- [ ] Add visuals: architecture diagram, result graphs, tables
- [ ] Optional feedback round from peers/supervisor

## ✅ Week 9 (June 16 – June 20): Polish & Submit

- [ ] Final proofreading and formatting
- [ ] Fix references, citations, and appendix (if needed)
- [ ] Submit final report + any deliverables 🎉
